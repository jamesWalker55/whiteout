# My Tauri Starter Template

This is based on Tauri's _"Tauri + Vue 3 + TypeScript"_ template. On top of that, this template does the following:

- Install frontend packages:
  - TailwindCSS
  - Unplugin Icons
- Add some basic build tasks for Jetbrains IDEs, like CLion
- Move `Cargo.toml` to root of project, so you can run `cargo` commands from the root folder
- Minimal TypeScript folder restructuring for personal use
- Delete built-in icons (`tauri.svg`, `vite.svg`, `vue.svg`)
- Remove unnecessary lines in base `index.html` file
